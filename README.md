***Arch Linux + Hyprland Configuration***

Essentially a bunch of configuration files i use for my Arch + Hyprland setup in one repository, enjoy!

**Required Packages:**

- playerctl
- hyprland
- waybar
- rofi
- wofi
- grim
- waypaper
- hyprpaper
- wclipboard
- neofetch
- sddm
- grub
- alacritty
- baobab
- pavucontrol
- networkmanager
- wlogout

I've probably missed a few but you can just mess around and find whatever packages this needs :)
